# Overview of Encryption Java fx program

This is a simple program that uses hash maps (key, value pairs). Each alphabetical character (key) is assigned a Japanese letter (value).  If the user types in any string with characters a-z it is "encrypted" to a Japanese.  Similarly, the contents of the text file are read into a string variable, encrypted and sent to the encrypted text file.
